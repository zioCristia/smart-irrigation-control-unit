# Smart irrigation expansion board
Expansion board for garden irrigation, with 7 differents triacs controlling solenoid valvs and one relay for the water pump.
This board should be attached to the [Esp energy monitor](https://github.com/zioCristia/esp-energy-monitor-v2) board.

The board's design allows it to be inserted into the rail of the home's breaker box by printing a 3D component.

### The rest will come soon
